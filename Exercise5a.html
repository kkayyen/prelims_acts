        <h1>Using VR Training to Boost Our Sense <br>
            of Agency and Improve Motor Control</h1>
        <p>With Japan's society rapidly aging, there has been a sharp increase in patients who experience motor dysfunctions.<br>
            Rehabilitation is key to overcoming such ailments.</p>
        <p>A researcher from Tohoku University has developed a new virtual reality (VR) based method that can benefit rehabilitation and<br>
            sports training by increasing bodily awareness and?improving motor control.</p>
        <p>His research was published in the Journal Scientific Report.</p>
        <p>Not only can we see and touch our body, but we can sense it too. Our body is constantly firing off information to our brains<br>
            that tell us where our limbs are in real-time. This process makes us aware of our body and gives us ownership over it.<br>
            Meanwhile, our ability to control the movement and actions of our body parts voluntarily affords us agency over our body.</p>
        <p>Ownership and agency are highly integrated and are related to our motor control.<br>
            However, separating our sense of body ownership from our sense of agency has long evaded researchers,<br>
            making it difficult to ascertain whether both ownership and agency truly affect motor control.</p>
        <p>Professor Kazumichi Matsumiya from the Graduate School of Information Sciences at Tohoku University could isolate these two senses by using VR.<br>
            Participants viewed a computer-generated hand, and Matsumiya independently measured their sense of ownership and agency over the hand.</p>
        <p>"I found that motor control is improved when participants experienced a sense of agency over the artificial body, regardless of their sense of body ownership," said Matsumiya.<br>
            "Our findings suggest that artificial manipulation of agency will enhance the effectiveness of rehabilitation and aid sports training techniques to improve overall motor control."</p>
